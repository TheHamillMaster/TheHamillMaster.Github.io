  <tr>
    <td>Mr Keen spoke at the front of the classroom and everybody listened to him. I learnt by simply using my brain and my ears to listen to the mark scheme so that I could MASTER EVERYTHING . I used a planning strategy to plan how I was going to MASTER this whole blogging thing. I planned that I would do this blog right now and that soon I will be a MASTER of Github.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was that I kept getting distracted by myself and the people around me. I need to work on listening more and talking less because there may have been some small details that I may have missed as I was distracted.  I also realised watching what Mr Keen had to say that I have to put more effort into my blogs and my Github page.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will learn from what Mr Keen has said about the mark scheme and act on it. I will look at the top of the scale on the mark scheme and make sure that everything on my blog is top notch. To do this I need to make sure that everything on my blog works with each other like the colours and I need to make sure that the actual blogs are detailed.</td>
