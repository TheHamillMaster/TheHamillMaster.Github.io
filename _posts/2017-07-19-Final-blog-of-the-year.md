    <td>Next time, I will manage my time more effectively. I will improve my learning by looking at the time limit in which we have to complete the challenge in and try to complete it by then. Also, I think I will improve my learning by thinking logically myself. I think that I rely on google too much instead of just trying to dive into the depths of my memory to try and see if I can think about how to complete the challenge myself. Also, if I do find something on google that could help me with a challenge, I think that writing it down could help improve my learning for the future so that I know when *I look at that that I am looking at something that I can do and I have done in the past.</td>
